# CouseraRProgramming_Assignments

This is a collection of my programming assignments from the John's Hopkins Data Science Certification through Coursera.

Each assignment was compiled and completed through RMarkdown and outputed in pdf format.  Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding any of these assignments at mkgibertjr@msn.com.

Best Wishes,
