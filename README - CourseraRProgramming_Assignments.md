# CouseraRProgramming_Assignments

This is a collection of my programming assignments from course 2 (R Programming) of the John's Hopkins Data Science Specialization through Coursera.

All files have the ASX tag in the beginning of the file name to denote which assignment they belong to.  For example, all files with the AS1 tag belong to assignment 1.

Each assignment was compiled and completed through RMarkdown with and associated pdf document. For those looking for a detailed explanation for each assignment, the pdf documents will provide any relevant information.

Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding any of these assignments at mkgibertjr@msn.com.

Best Wishes,

Myron G
